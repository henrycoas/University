HenryKingus-----------------------
- It is not necessary to hunt enemies all day long, it's better to check for round and decide wheter gather money (first day rounds) or follow enemies (last day rounds) to quickly kill them at night


KingusMk5-------------------------
- If a stronger warrior is two steps or closer, run away strategically
- If the enemy warrior has the same weapon as the ally, the ally will only attack him iff enemy is 1 hit from dying
- Bye, bye to guns_available booleans (it could be that one is unreachable for one warrior but not for another)
- Barricades won't be build in adjacent positions
- Barricades are not built to the max, they are now built one step below (increases chance enemies will waste time breaking them)


KingusMk4-------------------------
- Redefined constants


KingusMk3--------------------------
- Barricades are not for hiding anymore
- Directions' vector reversed


KingusMk2---------------------------
- Barricades in strategic points
- Bazooka warriors try to kill enemy warriors first; but if there aren't any close enough, they hunt builders


KingusMk1--------------------------
- Code reformatted and minimal improvements


Kingus----------------------------
- Takes into account how good a weapon on the floor is and how far it is to go and pick it up
- BFS fixed (the error was that it wasn't accounting the presence of enemies during day and distance wasn't initialized to 0 correctly)


Rift--------------------------------
- Implemented BFS but needs improvement when ally warrior doesn't have bazooka
- Builders now move correctly through the map


HenryOne----------------------------
- First version
